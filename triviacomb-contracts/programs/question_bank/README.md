# Question Bank Smart Contract

A comprehensive Solana smart contract for community-driven trivia question submission, curation, and validation using the Anchor framework.

## üéØ Overview

The Question Bank contract enables:
- **Community Question Submission**: Users submit trivia questions for review
- **Decentralized Curation**: Community voting on question quality
- **Reputation System**: Track user contributions and build trust

## üéÆ Usage Examples

### TypeScript Client Usage

```typescript
import { QuestionBankClient } from './client/question_bank_client';

// Initialize client
const client = createQuestionBankClient("devnet", wallet);

// Submit a question
const questionData = {
  questionText: "What is the capital of France?",
  options: ["London", "Berlin", "Paris", "Madrid"],
  correctAnswer: 2,
  category: "Geography",
  difficulty: 2,
};

const { tx, questionId } = await client.submitQuestion(questionData, userKeypair);

// Vote on question
await client.voteOnQuestion(questionId, true, voterKeypair);

// Finalize question (curator only)
await client.finalizeQuestion(questionId, curatorKeypair);

// Get approved questions
const approvedQuestions = await client.getApprovedQuestions("Geography", 2);
```

### Rust Integration

```rust
use question_bank::{QuestionData, VoteType};

// Submit question
let question_data = QuestionData {
    question_text: "What is 2 + 2?".to_string(),
    options: ["3".to_string(), "4".to_string(), "5".to_string(), "6".to_string()],
    correct_answer: 1,
    category: "Math".to_string(),
    difficulty: 1,
};

let accounts = SubmitQuestion {
    question: question_pda,
    question_bank: question_bank_pda,
    user_reputation: user_reputation_pda,
    submitter: user.key(),
    system_program: system_program::ID,
};

question_bank::cpi::submit_question(
    CpiContext::new(question_bank_program, accounts),
    question_data,
)?;
```

## üß™ Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
anchor test

# Run specific test file
anchor test tests/question_bank.ts

# Run with local validator
anchor test --skip-deploy
```

## üöÄ Integration Patterns

### Tournament Integration
```rust
// Get questions for tournament
let approved_questions = question_bank::cpi::get_approved_questions(
    CpiContext::new(question_bank_program, accounts),
    Some("Geography".to_string()),
    Some(2),
)?;

// Use in tournament creation
create_tournament(tournament_data, approved_questions)?;
```

### Frontend Integration
```typescript
// React component example
const QuestionSubmissionForm = () => {
  const { wallet } = useWallet();
  const client = useQuestionBankClient();
  
  const handleSubmit = async (formData) => {
    if (!await client.canUserSubmitQuestions(wallet.publicKey)) {
      throw new Error("Insufficient reputation");
    }
    
    const { tx, questionId } = await client.submitQuestion(formData, wallet);
    console.log(`Question ${questionId} submitted: ${tx}`);
  };
};
```

## üìà Reputation Economics

### Earning Reputation
- **Question Submission**: +5 points
- **Approved Question**: +50 points  
- **Voting Participation**: +10 points per vote

### Losing Reputation
